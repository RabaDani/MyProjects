## Business Logic Details

### Profit Calculation

For each vehicle assignment suggestion, the profit is calculated as follows:

1. **Travel Fee**:
   - â‚¬2 per kilometer traveled
   - â‚¬2 per each started half-hour of travel time

2. **Refueling Cost**:
   - Gasoline vehicles: â‚¬2 per km traveled
   - Electric vehicles: â‚¬1 per km traveled

3. **Special Rules**:
   - City trips (under 50km): 2 minutes per km
   - Highway trips (50km+): 1 minute per km
   - Hybrid vehicles in city: Range decreases by 1km for every 2km traveled

4. **Profit** = Travel Fee - Refueling Cost

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```

This will execute all unit and integration tests using **JUnit 5** and **Mockito** to ensure the application's functionality is correct.
